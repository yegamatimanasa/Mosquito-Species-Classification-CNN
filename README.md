# Mosquito-Species-Classification-CNN

This project employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify mosquito species with high accuracy. The development process includes data preprocessing, hyperparameter optimization, regularization techniques, and transfer learning. Advanced methods such as dropout, batch normalization, data balancing, cross-validation, and ensemble learning are used to enhance the model's robustness and accuracy.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation is available on Kaggle: [Mosquito on Human Skin Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/naiborhujosua/mosquito-on-human-skin). It includes images organized into the following categories:

- Aedes albopictus landing
- Aedes aegypti landing
- Aedes aegypti smashed
- Aedes albopictus smashed
- Culex quinquefasciatus landing
- Culex quinquefasciatus smashed
- Data splitting

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn
